In this project, we aim to optimize media spending for a business by leveraging data mining techniques to analyze the relationship between media spend and revenue. The company has been running multiple media channels to promote its products/services, and while it has ROI metrics to evaluate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), it is more interested in understanding how media spend influences revenue. Through machine learning and inferencing techniques, we seek to predict sales based on media spend, enabling the company to allocate resources effectively and optimize its media channel management.

## 1. Business Understanding
Via the regression, we can predict the sales from media spending. Therefore, the company would manage its media channel effectively. Several machine learning techniques were applied and the best predictor would be suggested. 

## 2. Data Understanding 
The Sales & Media Spend data was loaded via Colab. The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrimansaragih/dummy-advertising-and-sales-data (also please see Data_Dummy Data HSS.csv attached). Basic data analysis was performed to identify the shape of data, get column names, find missing values, and generate descriptive statistics. The Pearson correlation matrix was calculated to find the pairwise correlation of the columns in the data. All columns in the data are visually represented as histograms. A correlation heatmap figure was generated to represent the correlation matrix.

## 3. Data Preparation 
1. Define variables (X and y)
2. Get dummy variables 
3. Split the data into train and test datasets <br>
   train: 2727 data<br>
   test:  1819 data<br>
  
## 4. Modeling

The trade-off between interpretability and performance of these ML models. Highly interpretable algorithms such as linear regression, are often inaccurate because of high bias but low variance. Very accurate DNNs are a classic example of black boxes, with low bias but high variance. However, the model performance is highly associated with the data type. Several models were included for further evaluation:

* Linear Regression
* LASSO Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Elastic Net
* Decision Tree Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Gradient Boosting Regression (e.g., XGBoost)
* Neural Network Regression

## 6. Recommendation
### Inferencing
The linear model has demonstrated superior performance, making it a compelling candidate for a detailed analysis. Its simplicity and interpretability allow us to draw meaningful inferences for the entire population. The below summary table shows the R-square, Global F, coefficient, and p-value of the model:

 <img src="https://github.com/Taweilo/Sales_Prediction_from_Media_Spend/blob/main/Image/LR%20summary%20table.jpg" width="500">

* Adjusted R-square: 0.999 indicates that the model can explain approximately 99.9% of the variation in the dependent variable based on the independent variables included in the model. 
* p-value of Global F: 0.00 means statistical significance, so we are reasonably sure at least one variable is not 0. There is a relationship between independent and dependent variables in the population. 
* Model: Sales = -0.204 + 3.563 * (TV spend) + 0.007 * (Radio spend) + (-0.043) * (Social media spend) <br>
                 + 0.057 * (Influencer_Mega) <br>
                 + (-0.047) * (Influencer_Micro) <br>
                 + (-0.069) * (Influencer_Nano) <br><br>
**Influence_Macro is the reference group.** 

* p-value: Only the variable TV is statistically significant suggesting that we are reasonably sure the coefficient of TV is not 0 in the population. 

### Deployment
* code to predict test data  
```
y_pred = linear_regressor.predict(X_test)
```

### Limitation
1. The R-square is extremely high, only representing this dataset. It cannot suggest either the different marketing projects in this company, the other company's management, or the real situation. Different datasets would change the coefficient of the linear model, so the inferencing analysis is effective in this project. 
2. This model did not consider the interaction between the variables. The synergy effect could happen under a specific circumstance. Media channels could interact with each other. 
3. Even though the linear model explained the best, a further linear assumption can be checked: Homoscedasticity, Multicollinearity, Outlier, and Non-Constant Variance, etc.
