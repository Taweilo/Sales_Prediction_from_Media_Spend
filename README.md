In this project, we aim to optimize media spending for a business by leveraging data mining techniques to analyze the relationship between media spend and revenue. The company has been running multiple media channels to promote its products/services, and while it has ROI metrics to evaluate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), it is more interested in understanding how media spend influences revenue. Through machine learning and inferencing techniques, we seek to predict sales based on media spend, enabling the company to allocate resources effectively and optimize its media channel management.

The Sales & Media Spend data was loaded via Colab. The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrimansaragih/dummy-advertising-and-sales-data (also please see Dummy Data HSS.csv attached). Basic data analysis was performed to identify the shape of data, get column names, find missing values, and generate descriptive statistics. The Pearson correlation matrix was calculated to find the pairwise correlation of the columns in the data. All columns in the data are visually represented as histograms. A correlation heatmap figure was generated to represent the correlation matrix.
